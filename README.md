# Horsey-too-Late
This is a 2D chess set based on the Lichess emoji "Horsey" by cham, michael1241 as found here: https://github.com/ornicar/lila/blob/master/public/images/emoji/horsey.png. 
The horse piece in the "Horsey too Late" set is a slightly modified version of the original emoji design. All other pieces are of an original design.
